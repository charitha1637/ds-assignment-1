## Intro to Web Scraping

Web scraping is a method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications.

## Steps invloved in Web Scraping 

`Step 1` : Identify the target website.

`Step 2` : Collect URLs of the pages where you want to extract data from.

`Step 3` : Make a request to these URLs to get the HTML of the page.

`Step 4` : Use locators to find the data in the HTML.

`Step 5` : Save the data in a `CSV `file or some other structured format.

## 3.Intro to Data Preprocessing

Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm. Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.

## 4.Steps involved in Data Preprocessing

`Step 1` : Import the libraries.

`Step 2` : Import the data-set.

`Step 3` : Check out the missing values and outliers.

`Step 4` : See the Categorical Values.

`Step 5` : Splitting the data-set into Training and Test Set.

`Step 6` : Feature Scaling.
